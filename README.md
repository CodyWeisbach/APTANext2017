# APTA Next 2017

I'm collecting and doing some basic analysis on the tweets from the 2017 APTA Next Conference in Boston. 

I move away from the Boston area last year and can't make it back for the conference, so check out the action on Twitter is the next best thing. 

I'm going to look at the Tweets and see if I can take away anything from the conference despite not being able to be there and share it with others in the same situation. Hopefully it helps. 

This area is just where the code that I'll use to do the analysis will be. Check out [my website](http://codyweisbach.com) for more a more readable version of all of this.
